# despair.nvim

A soft fork of my monolith.nvim with removal of 90% of everything that's not completely necessary or that's related or is a plugin.

Also it is a test to how much of plugins I really need and how much of them I can replace with native vim/neovim functionality

#### This distro is not supposed or intended to be perfect out of the box experience. It is preconfigured to be vanilla-like friendly experience, but for your personal needs changing configs will be required.
#### If this doesn't suit you then please look at [other NeoVim distributions](#other-neovim-distributions)
